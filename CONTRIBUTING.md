# Contributing to easyGraph

So you're interested in giving us a hand? That's awesome! We've put together some brief guidelines that should help
you get started quickly and easily.

There are lots and lots of ways to get involved, this document covers:

* [raising issues](#report-a-bug)
    * [bug reports](#bug-reports)
    * [feature requests](#feature-requests)
    * [change requests](#change-requests)
* [working on Popcorn Time core](#working-on-popcorn-time-core)
    * [submitting pull requests](#submitting-pull-requests)
* [translation](#translation)


## Report a bug

If you're about to raise an issue because think you've found a problem with easyGraph, or you'd like to make a request
for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reasonâ€¦ please read this first.

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[feature requests](#feature-requests), [change requests](#change-requests) and [submitting pull
requests](#submitting-pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **search for existing issues**. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone
has already reported your problem or requested your idea.

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [the github issues](https://github.com/JairFrancesco/easyGraph/issues).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

### Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or look for [closed issues](https://github.com/JairFrancesco/easyGraph/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

3. **Include a screencast if relevant** - Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? The most helpful thing in the world is if we can *see* what you're talking about.
Use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your GitHub issue. Kapow.

3. Use the Bug Report template below to start creating a bug report with the template automatically or [click here](http://bit.ly/1MhADoe). 

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment.

Template Example :
```
Short and descriptive example bug report summary (title)

### Environment

The OS environment in which the issue occurs. 

### Steps to Reproduce
If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

1. This is the first step
2. This is the second step
3. Further steps, etc.

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. Especially, why do you consider this to be a bug? What do you expect to happen instead?
