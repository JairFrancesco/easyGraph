\subsection*{Report a bug}

If you\textquotesingle{}re about to raise an issue because think you\textquotesingle{}ve found a problem with easy\+Graph, or you\textquotesingle{}d like to make a request for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reasonâ€¦ please read this first.

The Git\+Hub issue tracker is the preferred channel for \href{#bug-reports}{\tt bug reports}, \href{#feature-requests}{\tt feature requests}, \href{#change-requests}{\tt change requests} and \href{#submitting-pull-requests}{\tt submitting pull requests}, but please respect the following restrictions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Please {\bfseries search for existing issues}. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your problem or requested your idea.
\item Please {\bfseries do not} use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use \href{https://github.com/JairFrancesco/easyGraph/issues}{\tt the github issues}.
\item Please {\bfseries do not} derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Bug Reports}

A bug is a {\itshape demonstrable problem} that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful -\/ thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Use the Git\+Hub issue search} --- check if the issue has already been reported.
\item {\bfseries Check if the issue has been fixed} --- try to reproduce it using the latest {\ttfamily master} or look for \href{https://github.com/JairFrancesco/easyGraph/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed}{\tt closed issues}.
\item {\bfseries Include a screencast if relevant} -\/ Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? The most helpful thing in the world is if we can {\itshape see} what you\textquotesingle{}re talking about. Use \href{http://www.cockos.com/licecap/}{\tt L\+I\+C\+Ecap} to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your Git\+Hub issue. Kapow.

\item Use the Bug Report template below to start creating a bug report with the template automatically or \href{http://bit.ly/1MhADoe}{\tt click here}.
